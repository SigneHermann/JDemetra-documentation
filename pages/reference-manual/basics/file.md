 The *File* menu is intended for working with [workspaces](workspace.html) and [data sources](data-providers.html) .  
It offers the following functions:  
* **New Workspace** – creates a new workspace and displays it in the Workspace window with a default name (*Workspace_#number*); 
* **Open Workspace** – opens a dialog window, which enables the user to select and open an existing workspace; 
* **Open Recent Workspace** – presents a list of workspaces recently created by the user and enables the user to open one of them; 
* **Save Workspace** – saves the project file named by the system under the default name (*Workspace_#number*) and in a default location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later point in time; 
* **Save Workspace As…** – saves the project file named by the user in the chosen location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later point in time; 
* **Open Recent** – presents a list of datasets recently used and enables the user to open one of them; 
* **Exit** – closes an application.
